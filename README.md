This is a simple budget tracking app that has functionality on and offline. 
The user is able to input a positive amount and add or subtrack this amount from the running total in the application.
Once offline, the user is still able to add expenses and once reconnected, the expenses will be subtracted from the total.
The app uses MongoDB Atlas and Heroku for deployment.
The application includes a service worker, web manifest, and uses IndexedDB for offline functionality.
